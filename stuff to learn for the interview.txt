MCE log 
corrective layer is when one bit is fliped... the mem we use ECC, if it has one bit fliped we softeare for this 

but if 2 or more are fliped.. we cannot fix that its too ambigious 
which will shut down a channel and memory will be lost

everything the OS is aware of DMESAG will let me know
